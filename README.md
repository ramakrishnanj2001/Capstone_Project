# Capstone_Project
My Engineering Final Year Project.

The outcome of the project is to create a web application to predict the engine health and carbon 
emissions of used vehicles. This app also would summarize the environmental impact and the 
resources used. The major advantage of this analysis is that all factors from the extraction of the 
resource to the state of the vehicle 50 years in the future will be considered, and with the help of 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, while accurately predicting the pollution caused due 
to physical degradation reducing the efficiency of the engine, thus factoring in the increase in 
pollution.
